# About the data
## This is a transactional data set containing the transactions for a UK-based non-store online retail. The company mainly sells unique all-occasion gifts.

## Build a Hybrid Recommendation system using various loss functions with LightFM library.

## Approach
1. Import required libraries
2. Read and merge the data
3. Perform data transformation
4. Perform train test split
5. Model building
6. Model building with loss function as WARP.
7. Model building with loss function as logistics
8. Model building with loss function as BPR
9. Combine the data to build the final model
10. Get recommendations

## Setup
1. Used Poetry for reproducible environments
2. The project was executed under WSL2 under WIndows 11 as I had issues installing LightFM on WIndows. Linux was straight forward.
